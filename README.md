# csci_653_project: Time Evolution of a Quantum State

This page will be updated with additional details as the project progresses.

This project aims to build a generalized program for calculating the time evolution of a quantum state. This will involve parsing input to generate a , diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then repeatedly applying the time evolution operator to an initial state. After running the time evolution, analysis will be performed to gind if there are any envelopes that can contain the oscilating state, and also finding the dominant frequency.


This project will likely be written in C and may make use of pre-existing libraries for diagonalization and fourier transforms.
